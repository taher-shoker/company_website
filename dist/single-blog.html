                  Investing for the first time is a significant milestone for anyone. But, one of the largest hurdles perspective investors face is that they want to start, but don’t know where to begin. There’s so much information and opinions surrounding the topic of investing that it can feel downright overwhelming.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before throwing in the towel, prospective investors should be aware of several easy access ways to start investing. This article dives deeper into a few of these options in an effort to educate those who want to start investing.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <h4>Retirement Plans</h4>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      One way to get started investing is through a retirement plan. Many future investors are employees and have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. The most common ones, and you have probably heard of them, are 401(k), 403(b) or 457(b) plans. They are all savings and investing plans offered (and sponsored) by employers to provide a tax advantaged way to set aside, and invest with, money for retirement. The main difference amongst the three is that 401(k)s are for for-profit companies, 403(b)s are generally for educators and nonprofit employees, and 457(b) plans are for government employees. But all three function in similar fashion.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Traditional 401(k), 403(b) and 457(b) plans are funded by the employer, the employee, or a combination of both, with pre-tax dollars. This means that employer and/or employee contributions are not included in gross income when first contributed to the plan and funds within the plan will grow tax-free until the employee/investor begins taking withdrawals from the plan in retirement. Some employers offer Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b) or Roth 457(b) plans which are also employer sponsored plans but unlike traditional 401(k), 403(b) or 457(b) plans, the employee’s money that is contributed is taxed before going into the Roth account. Similar to non-employer sponsored Roth IRA’s, investors will not have to pay taxes on that money ever, not even when making withdrawals in retirement (assuming the IRS rules are followed). Employers that offer a Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b) or Roth 457(b) that would like to contribute to the employee’s plan would have to do so through a traditional 401(k), 403(b) or 457(b) plan even though the employee’s contributions may be made to a Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b) or Roth 457(b); this means tax-free upon contribution but taxable upon withdrawal in retirement with respect to the employer contributions.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The investment choices for a 401(k), 403(b) or 457(b) plan can range from mutual funds, guaranteed investment contracts, stable value funds, company stock, listed stock, variable annuities, or some combination of these. Some plans even offer brokerage accounts which allow investors to select from a full range of listed stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Each company is different though, so it’s important to speak with the plan administrator to understand the investing options.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      But, what about investors that don’t have employer plans like this available to them? If their company doesn’t offer a workplace retirement plan, traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs (through a traditional or through a self-directed IRA custodian) are available to those who want to start investing for retirement but don’t have access to an employer sponsored plan. If they are self-employed, there are retirement plan options available to them such as SEP IRA’s, Solo 401(k)’s, SIMPLE IRA’s and more. Note, depending on how these plans are structured, it is possible to have more investment options than with employer sponsored plans in that one may not be limited to a short menu of mutual funds, listed stocks, bonds, etc.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      It is possible to have retirement savings in these non-employer sponsored plans invest in alternative (i.e., non stock exchange listed) assets such as real estate, gold, non-listed stocks, non-listed REITs, etc. What’s most important is saving for retirement. As the money is already set aside to grow for retirement, it is a good source of funds with which to start investing. Keep in mind that there is a slew of IRS rules, limitations and restrictions surrounding retirement accounts so seeking guidance from a qualified financial advisor might help to alleviate some stress.

                  <h4>Brokerage accounts</h4>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      A brokerage account is an account opened at a licensed brokerage firm through which an investor can buy and sell (i.e., trade) investments; typically stocks, mutual funds and bonds. There are different kinds of brokerage accounts so investors should decide what is important to them and/or what they are willing to pay for. Things to consider with respect to selecting a brokerage account:
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <h6>Full-service or managed brokerage account.</h6>
                        <p>
                          These brokerage accounts come with an investment manager. That investment manager could be a human being or could be robo-advisors which create portfolios for investors using algorithms based on set risk profiles and investment goals; by removing the human element it not only lowers fees but allows for people to create truly unique portfolios based on the type of risk they’re willing to take on. Deciding to go with one of these accounts comes down to how much guidance the investor desires, needs or wants and/or willing to pay for. Although there are fees associated with having a professional manager, it does help a new investor get started knowing as there would be a professional investment manager helping with investment decisions and/or for investors who prefer to be completely hands off.
